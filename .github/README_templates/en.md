## Avatar version display
From v1.1.0, when the action wheel is open, the version of avatar currently in use and whether it has been updated are displayed in the upper left corner of the screen.

![avatar version display](../README_images/version_information.jpg)

Updates are automatically checked once a day, but can also be done manually via the action wheel (default: B key).

A notification will be sent when a new avatar version is available. You can get the download link for the latest version from the action wheel, which you can access from your browser.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To check for avatar updates, you must turn on "Allow Networking" and add `api.github.com` to the Network Filter from Figura settings!

> [!CAUTION]
> It is DANGEROUS to use a network filter other than "Whitelist" when activating Figura's Networking Feature. Although this avatar uses secure links, there is no guarantee that links used by other players' avatars are secure. I'm not responsible for any damages caused by using this feature.

> [!WARNING]
> If you repeatedly check for updates in a short period of time, GitHub will impose a temporary restriction and avatar scripts will not be able to check for updates for a while.
